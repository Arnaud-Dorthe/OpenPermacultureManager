# Automatic accounting of business operations 

If you have not enabled the _auto accounting_ in the [configuration of your company](/backend/companies/edit), you can make it manually to create all the records corresponding to your operations.

You choose the date by which you want to record transactions and once selected you confirm if everything is correct.

**The accounting manual switch does not take into account the changes that were made on parts already included**. The recording in automatic mode allows for it to update accouting data as you work in commerce.
